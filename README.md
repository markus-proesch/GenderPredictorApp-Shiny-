# Gender Predictor Application in R Shiny 

Based on 30 audio respnses I built an interactive application that can predict the gender of the respondent. Using
Naive Bayes Classifier to predict either "male" = 1 and "female" = 0. The use cases and opporunities are endless to predict 
based on written or auido data.
